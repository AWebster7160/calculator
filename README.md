# calculator
A simple, on screen calculator to finish TOP Foundations!

02/02/2024 - First real project making use of objects to store and work with data.

02/04/2024 - Fun weekend project incorporating the calculator functions, some more refined css, and some of the animation skills I learned from the rock/paper/scissors project. The handling of large numbers could be slightly better, and in the future, I may revisit to add a cat paw on/off toggle, so the calc can be used without the input delay, but I'm happy with this result for now.
